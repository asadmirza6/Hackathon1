# Chatbot Integration

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course includes an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about the course content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## How It Works

The chatbot uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that:

1. Takes your question and searches through course materials
2. Retrieves the most relevant content
3. Generates a response based on the retrieved information
4. Provides source attribution for transparency

## Using the Chatbot

The chatbot is available as a floating widget on every page of the course. Simply click the robot icon in the bottom-right corner to open the chat interface.

### Context-Aware Queries

You can select text on any page and ask questions about it. The chatbot will use the selected text as context to provide more targeted answers.

## Technical Implementation

The chatbot is built with:

- **Frontend**: React component integrated with Docusaurus
- **Backend**: FastAPI-based RAG system
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant for semantic search
- **LLM**: Google Gemini for response generation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for query logging and analytics

## API Endpoints

The chatbot communicates with these backend endpoints:

- `POST /v1/query` - Submit a question and receive an AI response
- `GET /v1/health` - Check system health
- `GET /v1/logs` - Retrieve query history
- `GET /v1/logs/metrics` - Get analytics and performance metrics

## Privacy & Data Usage

All queries are logged for improving the system, but personal information is not stored. Query logs are used to identify popular questions and improve course content.
